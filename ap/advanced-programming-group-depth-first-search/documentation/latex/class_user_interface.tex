\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Facilitates user interactions for image and volume processing tasks. 

This class provides a command-\/line interface for applying a range of image processing techniques to 2D images and 3D volumes. It abstracts the complexities of the underlying operations, presenting the user with a set of clear options for loading, processing, and saving images and volumes. The class is structured around static methods, reflecting its role as a utility rather than an entity to be instantiated.\doxysubsubsection{Key Functionalities\+:}\label{class_user_interface_autotoc_md10}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \doxyref{Image}{p.}{class_image} processing\+: Allows the user to apply edge detection, blurring, color correction, and smoothing to 2D images.
\item \doxyref{Volume}{p.}{class_volume} processing\+: Enables the user to apply projections, slicing, and blurring to 3D volumetric data.
\item Loading and saving\+: Provides mechanisms for loading images and volumes from user-\/specified paths and saving the processed outputs.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The user interface is designed to be extensible, with the potential to add more processing functions as needed.
