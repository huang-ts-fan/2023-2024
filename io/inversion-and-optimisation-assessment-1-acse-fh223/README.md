# Inversion and Optimisation Assessment 1: Full-waveform inversion

Base repository for Assessment 1 of the EDSML and ACSE module Inversion and Optimisation.

The deadline for submission is at 12:00 GMT on February 23rd.

The assessment is based on material from the first two weeks of the course, but is primarily based on material from lectures 6-8. The assessment consists of 2 parts. Solutions for parts 1 and 2 should be placed in the two notebooks provided. It is not necessary to add any additional files to your submission, but should you wish to do so, please ensure they are located in the `data` folder.

See assessment.ipynb for the detailed assessment specification. Whilst the specification provides a good amount of structure and guidance, it is emphasised here that each section does not have a 'right' or 'wrong' answer. Many sensible approaches exist to each section and sub-section. In providing solutions, emphasis should be placed on explaining and demonstrating and understanding of why choices were made.

Note script `clear_devito_cache.py` present in this folder. In situations where notebooks start freezing, save your progress, close the notebook and execute this script. After re-opening the notebook, things should again work as normal.
