# Inversion and Optimisation Assessment 2

Base repository for Assessment 2 of the EDSML and ACSE module Inversion and Optimisation.

The deadline for submission is at 16:00 GMT on March 1.

The assessment is based on material from lectures 1-5 and 9-11.
It consists of three parts, each in a separate notebook. Please provide
your answers in the notebooks provided. If for some (sub)questions your prefer
a handwritten answer you may also commit these as photos and include them in the notebook. Please make sure the notebooks are committed with the output that you want me to look at. I may occasionally rerun some of your code - so it should be functional! - but in most cases I will use the output as was committed to mark your answer. Although this is probably not necessary, you may, if you wish, also add code in separate python modules, as long as it is clear from the notebook itself how you have answered the questions and I can see the output there.

You may use the standard scipy, numpy and matplotlib packages in your answers, except where otherwise indicated: in Q2 do *not* use scipy.optimize. In Q3 on the other hand you are allowed to use any solver and/or minimisation algorithm implemented in scipy. You may use any code from the lecture notes, tutorials and previous year's feedback, but make sure it is suitably adapted to the questions in this assessment.
