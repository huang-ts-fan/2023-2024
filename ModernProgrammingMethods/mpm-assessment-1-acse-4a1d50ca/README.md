# Modern Programming Methods
## Assessment 1: Cellular Automata

In this programming exercise, you will develop Python code providing implementations of several cellular automata. You will additionally develop suitable unit and function level tests and profile the code developed.

See [assessment.pdf](./assessment.pdf) for the full formal exercise definition.

A starter file, `automata.py` is provided and should be updated with your code. A starter test framework is available in the `tests` folder. All new tests should be added in the `test_automata.py` file.

__Reminder: This is an individual assessment.__

Although students are encouraged to discuss the problem background and coding techniques with their peers, you should not allow other students to examine your code, nor attempt to view the code of others. In cases of doubt, students may be examined on their submission via oral assessment.

If you use any non-Imperial websites during the course of this assessment, please list them in `References.md`

#### Suggested Workflow

You are recommended to work using a code editor such as VS Code, rather than working in Jupyter notebooks and copying material back and forth. Your work should be uploaded to GitHub before the submission deadline. See lecture 1 for details on how to `push` your work to GitHub.

For the purpose of this assessment, you can use the `ese-msc` environment with which you have been provided. There is no need to create a new environment (although you may of course do so if you wish) or update the `requirements.txt` file included with the repository.

#### Submission deadline

The final version of your module should be submitted via your GitHub Classrooms repository by 16:00 BST on Friday 13th October 2023.

To avoid technical issues, please try to upload versions of your work regularly as you progress.
